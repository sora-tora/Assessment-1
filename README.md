OOP Assessment 1
Hi, here’s my code, two things to note:
1) When I first got the skeleton code, it couldn’t load, so if for some reason that happens to you, just individually copy the classes into Visual Studio. Apologies if this happens, it’s a pain, and I don’t know how to fix it, but it’s fine if you make a new file.
2) You’ll have to change string filename in Program.cs to wherever you’re storing the testTextFile.txt.
